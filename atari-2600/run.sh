#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh -- run a 5 Card Stud client ROM in a FujiNet-patched MAME.
#
#   ./run.sh [rom] [lua-script]
#
# With a script it runs headless and exits; without one it opens a window.
# `rom` is a basename in build/ and defaults to texas.
#
# The MAME tree must have had fujinet-firmware/pico/atari-2600/emu/apply.sh
# run against it, and for anything that touches the network a fujinet-pc must
# be listening -- the cartridge model talks to a real one over BoIP.
#
# Four environment facts this wraps, each of which costs time to rediscover:
#   - MAME must run FROM ITS OWN TREE or -autoboot_script is silently ignored.
#   - SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy is required wherever there is no DISPLAY, because
#     SDL comes up before the video backend is chosen.
#   - fujinet-pc's BoIP listener takes ONE client, so a MAME left running
#     starves the next run and the symptom is a hang, not an error.
#   - THROTTLED IS NOT A PERFORMANCE CHOICE. The 5 Card Stud server's start
#     countdown and its move clock are WALL CLOCK, so an unthrottled run sits
#     at "starting in 2" forever and never gets a turn. Set FAST=1 only for a
#     screenshot of something that does not wait on the server.
