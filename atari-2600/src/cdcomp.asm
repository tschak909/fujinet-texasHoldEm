; cdcomp.asm -- bank 5: compose the whole table, in one frame of exactly the
; right length.
;
; THIS BANK EXISTS FOR A TIMING REASON, not a size one, which makes it the odd
; one out. Composing twenty-one rows is about 12,900 cycles. The display
; kernel's vblank -- the only blanked time a frame has, since DPADA and DPADB
; are the visible green bands -- is 2,812. So GWARM's recompose after a poll
; could not run inside a frame, and running it between frames made that frame
; about 430 scanlines instead of 262. A frame of a different length is a
; picture in a different place, so the table jumped, once every poll.
;
; There was no room to fix it in bank 1: cdgame had thirty-two bytes left.
;
; The first cut here spent a BLANKED frame of exactly 262 scanlines on the
; whole compose. That killed the jump but cost a black frame every poll, which
; is the blink. So it now does the opposite: it runs the display kernel, and
; composes a CHUNK PER FRAME, small enough to fit the vblank. The picture is up
; the whole time and every frame is 262 scanlines. A recompose takes a few
; frames during which the table is part old and part new, which for a poll that
; moved a clock digit is invisible and for a fresh deal reads as the cards
; arriving.
;
; How many chunks is decided by the timer, not by a constant: after each seat
; it asks INTIM whether there is room for another before the vblank runs out.
; TIMINT is checked FIRST, because reading INTIM clears the latch cdisp.inc is
; waiting on and doing that past zero would cost the frame a few scanlines.
;
; It carries a copy of render.inc rather than taking it away from bank 1,
; because bank 1 still composes the small things itself: the move bar on a
; cursor key is a couple of rows and fits the vblank budget with room to
; spare. Only the whole table does not. Every bank in this client carries its
; own copy of what it calls; this is that rule, not an exception to it.
;
; It therefore carries cdisp.inc and a row-colour table of its own, which is
; most of what a bank this size has to spend -- and is exactly why this could
; not have been done in bank 1.
