; vblank budget of 2,812, and the overrun does not get absorbed: it pushes the
; frame's first drawn line thirteen scanlines down the screen. Every keypress
; jolted the picture and then it snapped back.
;
; Ten of those thirteen rows are the table names, which a cursor key does not
; touch. What it touches is the bar and the seat count, and that is a
; zero-page store and one row.
;
; The cursor is the same red bar the move menu uses. There is no inverse video
; and no per-cell colour on this machine, so a whole-row band is the only
; highlight there is -- and having one highlight mean one thing everywhere is
; better than inventing a second. The kernel reads CDBAR on its seam line, so
