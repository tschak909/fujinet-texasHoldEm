; cdnet.asm -- bank 2: one request, and back.
;
; This bank exists for a size reason and it is not a small one. net.inc and
; url.inc are about 550 bytes together, and every bank carries its own copy of
; everything it calls; the game bank needs the display kernel, the renderer
; and the move menu and came in 552 bytes over with the network in it.
;
; A poll happens every ninety frames, so paying a bank switch for one costs
; nothing measurable.
;
; IT DOES CARRY THE DISPLAY KERNEL, though it composes nothing. A /state poll
; measured three to four frames of dead screen every ninety-four -- a flash,
; once a second and a half -- and it was not the network: two of those frames
; were the settle loop's own deliberate delay, spun blind in a bank that could
; not draw, and the rest was the transport waiting on ACKSEQ. Neither wait
; emits a VSYNC, so the picture did not go black so much as stop being a
; picture. net.inc now spends both of them in DFRAME instead, which redraws
; the table out of the text planes the cartridge is still holding.
;
; So CDHASUI is still 0 -- there is nothing to COMPOSE here, and the renderer
; and most of cdlib stay guarded out -- but cdisp.inc and a row-colour table
; are in, and APPVBL is an RTS because a frame drawn from inside a transaction
; must not start another one.
;
; The table below is the GAME screen's, and that is the whole reason the
; drawing path is gated on CDREQ: this bank is entered from the lobby too, and
; a bank has room for one CDBGT, not two.
