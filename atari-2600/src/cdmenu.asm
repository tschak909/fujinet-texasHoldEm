; Reached by the RESET switch at the table, or by pushing the stick LEFT. The
; 2600 has one button and four directions and no keypad, and the move menu
; already owns up, down and fire -- so left is what is left of the stick, and
; RESET is the only labelled button going spare. It is a SWITCH on this
; console, SWCHB bit 0, which the program reads: it restarts nothing, and what
; it means is the client's to choose. Both gestures also back OUT of here, for
; the same reason a door opens both ways.
